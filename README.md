matlab-scripts
==============

A repository for simple Matlab/Octave scripts.

* draw_arrow.m      draws an arrow.
* draw_arrow3.m     draws a 3d arrow.
* draw_line.m       draws a line within limits of the current plot.
* isoctave.m        checks if the script is running within Octave.
* makediag.m,       makediag_n.m replace blkdiag() function, which is slow in Octave.
* print_plot.m      prints plot with specified parameters.
* merge_structs.m   merges two structures with conflicting fields.
* normalize_cols.m  normalize columns
* normalize_rows.m  normalize rows
* polycubic.m       generates cubic polynomial with given boundary conditions,
                    computes positions, velocities, and accelerations at given
                    time moments
